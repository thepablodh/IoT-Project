Gateway group - Akin, Haagenson, Rushing

Scope - We are responsible for building and running a server in the networking lab connected to a switch 
for physical ethernet connection to the raspberry pi nodes. We anticipate receiving muster information over MQTT,
according to the following API, but the specifics of the MQTT architecture will be given to us by the Networking Group.

Flow of information:
- We will get information over MQTT from the nodes
- The information will be stored in a mySQL database on the gateway
- We will build an Apache2 server and a simple HTML front-end for interface with the mySQL server.

We are writing our portion in Java (because we need Java practice for thesis work).

API:
Here is the information that we think we need to receive over MQTT as a single string for each login, in this order, comma delimited:
1. Sending node identifier as a topic string (node_id)
2. MAC address (with colons)
3. Time stamp (formatted as date and time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MSEC)

Example MQTT topic and message:
    topic: "node1"
    message: "01:23:45:67:89:ab,2016-08-18 18:48:05.123456"
